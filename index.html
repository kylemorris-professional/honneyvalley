                <div class="benifit-of-honey-grid-item">

                    <h2>in Antioxidants</h2> 
                    <p>many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our dailey diet, whether as a natural sugar substitute for our coffe or simply as a sweet treat. But specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="benifit-of-honey-grid-item">
                    <h2>Improves Cholesterol</h2>           
                    <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL(bad)Cholesterol by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. Honey may also increase HDL(good) Cholesterol by about 3%.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>natural Cough Medicine</h2>                
                    <p>Honey is a time honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study, it can also relieve coughs more effectivly that OTC medications that contain dextromethorphan(DM), a cough suppressant. You can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with hearbal tea or warm water and lemon</p>

                    <h2>Lowers Blood Pressure</h2>
                    <p>Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and Honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidants compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.</p>

                    <h2>Improves Heart Health</h2>
                    <p>It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants could help imporve cholesterol levels, whcih could help decrease the risk for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm those findings.</p>

                    <h2>Antibacterial properties</h2>                
                    <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, whcih may account for some of its antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar conent, which can help stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionaly, honey has a low pH level. This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.</p>
